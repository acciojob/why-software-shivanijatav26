    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I am passionate about solving problems 
        using technology. Programming allows me to create solutions that can make people's 
        lives easier, automate tasks, and innovate new tools. I enjoy learning new programming 
        languages and frameworks, and I am motivated by the challenge of building efficient, 
        user-friendly software. Being a developer also provides the opportunity to work in 
        a constantly evolving field, collaborate with creative minds, and contribute to projects 
        that can have a real impact on society.
